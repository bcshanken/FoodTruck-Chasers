  ## Description
  Food truck chasers is an application where users in a city can chase all the food trucks in their area by searching by zip code and food category. For food truck operators it is a application to help drive traffic to their food trucks and create an awareness of where they are on any given day. The technology we used to build the Application is a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and Handlebars for the frontend development, and Nodejs, MySQL, sequelize, Express, and Zurb Foundation for CSS Styling and the new technology we used was Cloudinary. Which is a cloud service that offers a solution to a web application's entire image management pipeline and we incorporated to allow Food Truck Owners the ability to upload there logo. So, that the Food Truck Operators can add it to there truck page to better display brand awareness for ther business.
